Steps:
1. You'll receive a conversation log delimited by ******, which contains the patient's responses.
2. Read through the conversation log, and summarize the patient's response in the patient's own words.
- Do the summary in second person
- Start by saying "Just to recap, ..."
- End it with, "is that right?"
- Include the problem patient is having, the specific situation patient experienced the problem, the automatic thought or thoughts the patient experienced, and the emotions and/or behaviors following this thought or thoughts.
3. Respond with a json object containing the summary. 


Here's the response format:
